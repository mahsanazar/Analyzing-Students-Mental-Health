# Analyzing-Students-Mental-Health

## Studying abroad can be both exciting and difficult. But what might be contributing to this? One Japanese international university decided to find out!

Studying abroad presents a unique blend of excitement and challenges. However, what factors contribute to the emotional well-being of students in this context? To shed light on this question, a Japanese international university conducted a comprehensive study in 2018, which was subsequently published in 2019 after receiving approval from various ethical and regulatory bodies.

## Study Findings:
The research unveiled compelling insights. It revealed that international students face a heightened susceptibility to mental health issues compared to the general populace. Moreover, the study identified two pivotal factors: social connectedness, referring to one's sense of belonging within a social group, and acculturative stress, denoting the stress associated with adapting to a new culture. Remarkably, these factors emerged as predictive indicators of depression among international students.

## Project Objective:
In this SQL project, we aim to delve into the dataset utilized in the aforementioned study. By analyzing the data, we seek to validate whether our findings align with the conclusions drawn by the university's research. Through meticulous examination and interpretation of the data, we endeavor to discern the impact of international education on the mental health of students.
